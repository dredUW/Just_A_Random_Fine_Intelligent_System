# Project 2 - J.A.S.I.S. - Just A Somewhat Intelligent System

## Overview
Evaluation to determine which of the following three models yields the best predictive result when analyzing historical stock data.
* Neural Network
* Time-Series
* Decision Tree and Random Sampling  

The key takeaway is that it is extremely difficult to predict stock returns.
